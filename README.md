### Introducing Convolutional KAN Networks!
This project extends the idea of the innovative architecture of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to the Convolutional Layers, changing the classic linear transformation of the convolution to learnable non linear activations in each pixel.

### What is a KAN?
KANs are promising alternatives of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). KANs have strong mathematical foundations just like MLPs: MLPs are based on the universal approximation theorem, while KANs are based on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. KANs and MLPs are dual: KANs have activation functions on edges, while MLPs have activation functions on nodes. KAN seems to be more parameter efficient than MLPs, but each KAN Layer has more parameters than a MLP layer.

### What is a KAN Convolution?
KAN Convolutions are very similar to convolutions, but instead of applying the dot product between the kernel and the corresponding pixels in the image, we apply a **Learnable Non Linear activation function** to each element, and then add them up. The kernel of the KAN Convolution is equivalent to a KAN Linear Layer of 4 inputs and 1 output neuron. For each input i, we apply a ϕ_i learnable function, and the resulting pixel of that convolution step is the sum of ϕ_i(x_i). This can be visualized in the following figure.

### Parameters in a KAN Convolution
Suppose that we have a KxK kernel. In this case, for each element of this matrix we have a ϕ, which its parameter count is: gridsize + 1. For implementation issues, efficient kan defines:
![image](./images/splines.png)

This gives more expressability to the activation function b. So the parameter count for a linear layer is gridsize + 2. So in total we have K²(gridsize + 2) parameters for KAN Convolution, vs only K² for a common convolution. Consider that gridsize is typically (in our experiments) between k and k², but k tends to be a small value, between 2 and 16. 
## Results
The different architectures we have tested are:
- KAN Convolutional Layers connected to Kan Linear Layers (KKAN)
- Kan Convolutional Layers connected to a MLP (KANC MLP)
- CKAN with Batch Normalization between convolutions (CKAN_BN)
- CNN (Classic Convolutions connected to a MLP) 
- Normal Conv & KAN (Classic Convolutions and KANs after the flatten.
They can be seen in the following Figures:

### Conclusion
We have found out that with equal architectures, KAN Convolutions seem to "learn more", showing better accuracy in the analogous models except in the "Big" ones, where the difference was that we added more fully connected layers, which may be doing the learning instead of the convolutions. 

When using KANs after the flatten, KAN Convolutions achieve better accuracy than we can classic convolutions even using half the parameters. This is seen in the comparisons between KKAN and Normal Conv \& KAN. 

When trying an MLP, KAN convolutions achieve higher accuracy in the small models, but when having a 2 layer MLPs, the classic CNN wins by 0.41% with 26.62k parameters. While KAN Convolutions seem to learn more per kernel, we have to consider that each KAN kernel has much more parameters. So comparing the same architectures gives an advantage in terms of expressibility to KAN Convolutions. 

A key factor here is that KANs seem to maintain accuracy with lower parameter count, KANC MLP (Medium) achieves 88.99% with almost 15k parameters, but the training time is almost 10 times slower with the current implementations of KANs and its derivatives.  

Additionally, MLPs show a better performance than KANs for image classification tasks. In the "Small" and "Medium" cases, when using KAN Convolutions, using MLPs after the flatten gives both better accuracy and smaller parameters counts than using KANs. As expected, KKANs achieve better accuracy than its equal CNNs, but the parameter count difference is too big (22k vs 1.5k and 38k vs 3k). Since the parameters of KAN layers grow much faster than those of MLPs, with no apparent gain in accuracy, KANs might not be suitable as dense layers, especially because CNNs require a large number of neurons after the flattening layer.

Based on the original KAN paper proposal that KANs are more interepretable, we have tried to find a way to interpret this new type of convolutions, but at the moment, we have not found any clear way to visualize the B-Splines learned in each pixel of the convolutions. Given that we are working on images, it seems that the classic approach of visualizing what the filter does to the image seems the more 'human' way to get a sense of what is being learned, but because of the high dimensionality of a KAN kernel input-output relationship, at the moment we haven't come up with any interpretation.
